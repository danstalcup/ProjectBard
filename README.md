# Project Bard

Project Bard is a very simple C# framework for a state-driven, turn-based application engine with subscription-driven input and output and a data repository. It was designed with development of text-based, turn-based games in mind.

A basic, console-based implementation of the framework, SimpleBard, is included.

A sample game using Project Bard is currently in development.
